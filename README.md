This is the first step, and the most fun, in the application – The Code Introduction. Yes, we want you to do a little coding challenge – don't panic. Why? Simply to see that you’ve touched on programming before and know what you’re getting yourself into and can reflect upon your experiences after trying it out. This is a learning exercise. It will be fun, we promise.

### :runner: I have stretched my Goals

If you managed to do everything super quickly and can't get enough of coding, here's some suggestions of what you can add. TOTALLY optional.

1. Use a custom font using [Google fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1001467%20%7C%20Material.IO%20%7C%20Global%20%7C%20en%20%7C%20Hybrid%20%7C%20Text%20%7C%20BKWS&utm_term=%7Bkeyword%7D&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItcCyxeaG2AIVwbYYCh3OtgmsEAAYASAAEgJ6O_D_BwE)

### :books:

If you haven't coded before we suggest these resources to get you started, but feel free to Google!  

* [What is HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [Getting started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)

### :sos:
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. Google will very much be you friend in this! Try searching for your questions on Google or for example in an online development community like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) .

### :boom: Success!

After completing this challenge we hope that you will understand more what programming is and if it's for you. You will also gain some knowledge in two of the biggest programming languages, HTML and CSS. But most of all, we hope you had fun!
